# Backend — SecOPs API

Part of the SecOPs multi-tenant SOC SaaS platform (SIEM, SOAR, CTI, EDR, DFIR, VM modules).
See root `CLAUDE.md` for overall project context.

# Stack

- NestJS (modular monolith — not microservices)
- PostgreSQL with Prisma

# Architecture decisions

- Shared-database multi-tenancy with `tenant_id` isolation on relevant tables/queries
- Unified `SecurityModule` contract interface that each security module (SIEM, SOAR, CTI,
  EDR, DFIR, VM) implements, for consistency across the platform
- Redis deferred — don't introduce it unless there's a clear need

# Conventions

- Don't guess at vulnerabilities or root causes — enumerate and verify first
- Manual, step-by-step fix instructions preferred over full file replacements when debugging
  existing configs/workflows (preserves credentials and state)
